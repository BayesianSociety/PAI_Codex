# GILD (Gilead Sciences) Research Note
Date: 2026-02-24
Ticker: GILD

## Scope and method
- Evidence-first, using SEC filings and Gilead earnings materials as primary sources.
- Where the latest annual filing was not directly available in this run, I use the latest filed 10-Q plus the latest earnings release and mark assumptions.

## 1) Revenue, operating income, net income trend (last 8 quarters)
GAAP USD millions.

| Quarter | Revenue | Operating income | Net income attributable to Gilead |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 Q1 | 6,686 | (4,322) | (4,170) |
| 2024 Q2 | 6,954 | 2,644 | 1,614 |
| 2024 Q3 | 7,545 | 888 | 1,253 |
| 2024 Q4 | 7,569 | 2,451 | 1,783 |
| 2025 Q1 | 6,667 | 2,237 | 1,315 |
| 2025 Q2 | 7,082 | 2,474 | 1,960 |
| 2025 Q3 | 7,769 | 3,327 | 3,052 |
| 2025 Q4 | 7,925 | 1,984 | 2,183 |

Read-through:
- Revenue trend is upward from 2024 Q1 to 2025 Q4.
- Earnings are volatile quarter-to-quarter (notably 2024 Q1 loss and 2025 Q3 spike).
- 2025 full-year (release) shows revenue $28.8B, operating income $10.0B, net income $8.5B.

## 2) US vs international contribution (best available geographic proxy)
Best available proxy from latest filed 10-Q (quarter ended 2025-09-30):
- 2025 Q3 total revenue: US $5,281M, Europe $1,555M, Rest of World $933M.
- US share: 68.0%; International share (Europe + RoW): 32.0%.

9M 2025 mix:
- US $15,000M of $21,518M total (69.7%).
- International $6,518M (30.3%).

Assumption:
- I use 2025 Q3/9M geographic mix as proxy for current run-rate pending direct extraction of 2025 10-K geographic table.

## 3) Free cash flow trend and main drivers
Defined as operating cash flow (OCF) minus capex (purchases of PP&E), GAAP cash flow lines.

2025 quarterly/ytd trend (USD millions):
- Q1 2025: OCF 1,757; capex 104; FCF 1,653.
- Q2 2025 (implied from 6M less Q1): OCF 827; capex 107; FCF 720.
- Q3 2025 (implied from 9M less 6M): OCF 4,108; capex 147; FCF 3,961.
- 9M 2025: OCF 6,692; capex 358; FCF 6,334.
- 9M 2024 comparison: OCF 7,853; capex 376; FCF 7,477.

Main drivers (company disclosure):
- Higher inventory build-up.
- Unfavorable timing of collections.
- Higher income tax payments (including final transition tax installment).
- Partially offset by favorable timing of operating payments.

## 4) Balance sheet health: cash, debt, lease liabilities
- Cash/cash equivalents + marketable debt securities: $10.6B (as of 2025-12-31, earnings release).
- Debt (latest filed 10-Q, 2025-09-30): current debt $2.806B + long-term debt $22.135B = $24.941B.
- Lease liabilities (latest directly extracted annual disclosure in this run): discounted lease liabilities $611M (2024-12-31).

Health read:
- Large liquidity cushion, but meaningful gross debt load.
- Net debt proxy is still positive (debt above cash+securities).
- Lease burden appears manageable relative to operating scale.

## 5) Valuation snapshot (with caveats)
Price anchor used: $151.12 (MarketWatch quote captured 2026-02-19).

Inputs and proxies:
- Share count proxy: ~1.242B (2025-09-30 filing balance sheet share count).
- Market cap proxy: ~$187.7B.
- Net income (FY2025 release): $8.51B.
- Debt proxy: $24.94B (2025-09-30 filing).
- Cash+securities: $10.6B (2025-12-31 release).
- EV proxy: ~$202.0B.

Multiples:
- P/E (proxy): ~22.1x (market cap / FY2025 net income).
- EV/EBITDA (rough proxy): ~16x-17x.
- FCF yield (proxy): ~4.5% (annualized from 9M 2025 FCF / market cap).

Caveats:
- This is not a point-in-time vendor calc; it blends latest filed balance sheet (Q3) with Q4 earnings release liquidity.
- EBITDA proxy is approximate because full TTM D&A extraction was incomplete in this run.
- FCF yield uses annualized 9M data (not final audited FY capex split).

## 6) Key risks and 12-month bull/base/bear scenarios
Key risks:
- Product concentration and competitive pressure in HIV and oncology.
- Regulatory/pricing pressure (especially US reimbursement dynamics).
- Pipeline execution risk and clinical/regulatory outcomes.
- Cash conversion volatility from working capital and tax timing.
- M&A/integration and allocation risk given large cash generation.

12-month scenarios:
- Bull: Oncology/HIV execution beats, margins hold near 2025 levels, cash conversion normalizes; multiple expands toward higher-teens EV/EBITDA.
- Base: Mid-single-digit top-line growth, margin normalization from 2025 peaks, stable cash generation; valuation stays around current range.
- Bear: Volume/price pressure plus pipeline disappointments and weaker cash conversion; earnings de-rate and multiple compresses.

## Assumptions explicitly flagged
- 2025 10-K was not directly extracted during this run; Q4 2025 values are from earnings release.
- Geographic mix uses latest filed 10-Q (Q3 2025) as proxy.
- EV/EBITDA and FCF yield are approximate due mixed-period inputs.
