## 1) Revenue, Operating Income, Net Income Trend (Last 8 Quarters)
All figures are GAAP, USD millions.

Method notes:
- Q2/Q3/Q4 values are from quarter-specific columns in Vertex earnings exhibits (Ex-99.1 in 8-K filings).
- Q1 2025 and Q1 2024 are derived from Q2 2025 six-month totals minus Q2 quarter values.

| Quarter | Revenue | Operating Income | Net Income |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 Q1 | 2,690.6 | 1,139.5 | 1,099.6 |
| 2024 Q2 | 2,645.6 | (3,514.7) | (3,593.6) |
| 2024 Q3 | 2,771.9 | 1,116.3 | 1,045.4 |
| 2024 Q4 | 2,912.0 | 1,026.0 | 913.0 |
| 2025 Q1 | 2,770.2 | 630.1 | 646.3 |
| 2025 Q2 | 2,964.7 | 1,151.1 | 1,032.9 |
| 2025 Q3 | 3,076.4 | 1,186.2 | 1,082.9 |
| 2025 Q4 | 3,190.0 | 1,205.9 | 1,191.1 |

Read-through:
- Revenue trend is up sequentially through 2025.
- The major distortion is 2024 Q2 (Alpine-related AIPR&D), after which operating and net income normalize and improve.

## 2) Geographic Contribution (U.S. vs International, when available)
Vertex provides U.S. vs outside-U.S. commentary in earnings materials.

2025 full year (from Q4/FY2025 release):
- U.S. revenue: **$7.55B**
- Outside U.S. revenue: **$4.45B**
- Mix: **62.9% U.S. / 37.1% outside U.S.**

Selected quarter color:
- Q4 2025: U.S. **$2.06B**, outside U.S. **$1.13B**
- Q3 2025: U.S. **$1.98B**, outside U.S. **$1.10B**
- Q2 2025: U.S. **$1.85B**, outside U.S. **$1.12B**

Takeaway:
- Geography remains U.S.-weighted, but non-U.S. is a meaningful and growing contributor, helped by CF ex-U.S. demand and CASGEVY expansion.

## 3) Free Cash Flow Trend and Main Drivers
Definition used: **FCF = Cash flow from operations (CFO) - Purchases of property and equipment (capex)**.

Quarterly FCF (where quarterly cash-flow detail is available from 10-Qs):

| Quarter | CFO | Capex | FCF |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 Q1 | 1,306.6 | 68.4 | 1,238.2 |
| 2024 Q2 | (3,753.6) | 69.0 | (3,822.6) |
| 2024 Q3 | 1,369.8 | 67.7 | 1,302.1 |
| 2025 Q1 | 818.9 | 40.7 | 778.2 |
| 2025 Q2 | 1,073.1 | 145.7 | 927.4 |
| 2025 Q3 | 1,241.4 | 101.8 | 1,139.6 |

Main drivers:
- 2024 Q2 cash flow is the obvious trough, tied to Alpine transaction impacts and related operating/investing distortions in 2024 disclosures.
- 2025 cash generation re-accelerates as operating profitability normalizes and scales.
- Capex stays manageable versus operating cash generation.

Caveat:
- A full 8-quarter quarterly FCF series is not fully reconstructible from the latest Q4 earnings exhibit alone because it does not provide a full quarterly cash-flow statement for Q4 periods.

## 4) Balance Sheet Health (Cash, Debt, Lease Liabilities)
Latest available filing snapshot (Q4/FY2025 earnings exhibit, filed Feb 12, 2026):
- Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (current): **$6.61B**
- Long-term marketable securities: **$5.71B**
- Total cash + marketable securities: **~$12.32B**
- Total current liabilities: **$3.86B**
- Long-term operating lease liabilities: **$1.85B**
- Total assets: **$25.64B**

Debt view:
- The condensed balance sheet in the earnings exhibit does not present a separate debt line item, supporting a low-leverage profile.
- Third-party ratio screens (cross-check only) show low net leverage relative to cash generation.

## 5) Valuation Snapshot (with caveats)
Market-multiple snapshot (StockAnalysis, accessed 2026-02-24):
- Trailing P/E: **33.60x**
- EV/EBITDA: **23.58x**
- P/FCF: **36.34x**
- Implied FCF yield (1 / P/FCF): **~2.75%**

Caveats:
- Multiples change intraday with price and may differ by vendor methodology (TTM windows, EBITDA normalization, lease treatment).
- EV/EBITDA from screeners is not always directly comparable to filing-derived EBITDA unless definitions are matched exactly.
- FCF yield here is equity-yield style from P/FCF inversion, not enterprise FCF yield.

## 6) Key Risks and 12-Month Bull / Base / Bear Scenarios
### Key risks
- CF franchise concentration and potential pricing/reimbursement pressure.
- Launch execution risk (JOURNAVX, CASGEVY expansion pace, ex-U.S. access cadence).
- Clinical/regulatory binary risk in near-term pipeline (e.g., povetacicept filing/outcomes and other late-stage programs).
- Expense re-acceleration (commercial ramp + R&D intensity) reducing operating leverage.
- Policy/tax/tariff and market-access shifts affecting net realized pricing.

### 12-month scenario framework
#### Bull
- Assumptions: CF remains resilient, non-CF launches outperform, key pipeline catalysts hit on timing/quality.
- Financial implications: sustained double-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, stronger FCF conversion.
- Valuation implications: premium multiple sustains or expands.

#### Base
- Assumptions: CF growth steady, non-CF ramps gradually, pipeline mixed but without major negative surprise.
- Financial implications: mid/high single-digit revenue growth, stable-to-modestly higher margin, solid FCF.
- Valuation implications: multiples broadly range-bound.

#### Bear
- Assumptions: slower launch uptake and/or adverse clinical/regulatory outcomes; higher spend persists.
- Financial implications: slower top-line growth, margin compression, weaker FCF trajectory.
- Valuation implications: de-rating pressure on P/E and EV/EBITDA.
