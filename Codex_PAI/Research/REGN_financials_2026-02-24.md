## 1) Revenue, Operating Income, Net Income Trend (Last 8 Quarters)
All figures USD millions (GAAP).

| Quarter | Revenue | Operating Income | Net Income |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 Q1 | 3,145.0 | 1,339.7 | 1,199.7 |
| 2024 Q2 | 3,548.6 | 1,413.4 | 1,110.5 |
| 2024 Q3 | 3,715.2 | 1,522.9 | 1,251.8 |
| 2024 Q4 | 3,790.3 | 1,157.1 | 928.4 |
| 2025 Q1 | 3,029.4 | 640.3 | 807.1 |
| 2025 Q2 | 3,674.5 | 1,220.0 | 1,042.7 |
| 2025 Q3 | 4,037.3 | 1,603.5 | 1,348.2 |
| 2025 Q4 | 3,456.7 | 2,407.1 | 1,308.5 |

Quick read:
- Revenue was volatile but 2025 TTM reached ~$14.2B.
- Operating income dipped sharply in 2025 Q1, then rebounded strongly through 2025 Q4.
- Net income tracked similar recovery; 2025 Q4 net margin remained high despite lower revenue vs 2025 Q3.

## 2) North America vs International Contribution
Regeneron reports **U.S. vs rest-of-world (ROW)** net product sales in the 2025 10-K (not explicit North America ex-U.S. split).

| Year | U.S. Net Product Sales | ROW Net Product Sales | U.S. Mix | ROW Mix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 | 10,533.5 | 3,868.0 | 73.1% | 26.9% |
| 2025 | 8,507.2 | 4,903.8 | 63.4% | 36.6% |

Takeaway:
- International contribution increased materially in 2025.
- Caveat: this table is for **net product sales**, not total consolidated revenue (which also includes collaboration/royalty revenue).

## 3) Free Cash Flow Trend and Main Drivers
Method: quarterly FCF approximated as `CFO - purchases of property, plant, and equipment` (USD millions), derived from quarterly and YTD cash-flow statements.

| Quarter | CFO | Capex | FCF |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2024 Q1 | 1,005.7 | 99.5 | 906.2 |
| 2024 Q2 | 921.0 | 80.1 | 840.9 |
| 2024 Q3 | 1,187.2 | 110.8 | 1,076.4 |
| 2024 Q4 | 1,344.7 | 115.4 | 1,229.3 |
| 2025 Q1 | 420.4 | 217.0 | 203.4 |
| 2025 Q2 | 1,139.1 | 218.2 | 920.9 |
| 2025 Q3 | 1,849.4 | 171.1 | 1,678.3 |
| 2025 Q4 | 1,367.2 | 240.4 | 1,126.8 |

Trend summary:
- 2025 Q1 was the clear trough (weaker operating cash + elevated capex).
- FCF normalized in Q2 and was very strong in Q3/Q4.
- 2025 full-year FCF (~$3.93B) was slightly below 2024 (~$4.05B), mainly due to higher capex and intra-year working-capital volatility.

## 4) Balance Sheet Health (Cash, Debt, Leases)
Latest balance-sheet snapshot (Dec 31, 2025):
- Cash and cash equivalents: **$9.08B**
- Marketable securities: **$8.57B**
- Total immediate liquidity (cash + marketable securities): **~$17.65B**
- Debt: **No material short-term or long-term debt line item disclosed on face of balance sheet**
- Lease liabilities:
- Current operating lease liabilities: **$121.7M**
- Long-term operating lease liabilities: **$295.2M**
- Total operating lease liabilities: **$416.9M**

Assessment:
- Net cash position is very strong.
- Lease obligations are manageable relative to liquidity and cash generation.

## 5) Valuation Snapshot (with caveats)
Market data below is from third-party market-data pages on/near 2026-02-24 and can update intraday.

- Share price: **~$775.52** (FinanceCharts snapshot)
- Market cap: **~$83.54B** (FinanceCharts)
- P/E (TTM): **~18.65x** (FinanceCharts)
- EV/EBITDA (TTM): **~13.74x** (FinanceCharts)
- FCF yield: **~4.95%** (FinanceCharts)

Cross-check from filings:
- 2025 FCF (approx): **$3.93B**
- Using ~$83.5B market cap implies implied FCF yield of **~4.7%**, broadly consistent with the third-party figure.

Valuation caveats:
- Multiples depend on source methodology (GAAP vs adjusted EBITDA; diluted share count timing).
- Quote/market cap values are time-sensitive and may be stale by the next trading session.
- Enterprise value may vary based on treatment of investments, leases, and minority items.

## 6) Key Risks + 12-Month Bull/Base/Bear Scenarios
### Key risks
- U.S. EYLEA franchise pressure (competitive dynamics / pricing / mix).
- Clinical and regulatory binary outcomes across late-stage pipeline.
- Concentration risk in a few major products and partnered economics.
- U.S./global pricing and reimbursement policy changes.
- Manufacturing/supply execution and potential legal/IP exposures.

### Scenario framework (next 12 months)
#### Bull
- Assumptions: stronger-than-expected EYLEA HD execution, continued ex-U.S. growth, favorable pipeline/regulatory milestones.
- Financial read-through: revenue growth re-accelerates; operating leverage lifts margin.
- Valuation read-through: multiple expands toward high-teens EV/EBITDA / low-20s P/E.

#### Base
- Assumptions: EYLEA pressure partly offset by pipeline/partnered growth; no major binary setbacks.
- Financial read-through: low-single-digit top-line growth with stable-to-modestly improving margin.
- Valuation read-through: valuation remains around current mid-teens EV/EBITDA and high-teens P/E.

#### Bear
- Assumptions: faster erosion in key legacy franchise and/or pipeline setbacks; higher spend without commensurate revenue.
- Financial read-through: flat-to-down revenue, margin compression, lower FCF conversion.
- Valuation read-through: de-rating toward low-teens P/E / low-teens EV/EBITDA.
