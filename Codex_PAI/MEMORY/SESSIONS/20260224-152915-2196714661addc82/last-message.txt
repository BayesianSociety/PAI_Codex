It includes:
- 8-quarter trend for revenue, operating income, and net income
- U.S. vs international contribution (using available disclosed splits)
- FCF trend with drivers (from 10-Q cash-flow statements)
- Balance sheet health (cash, liabilities, lease obligations, leverage view)
- Valuation snapshot (P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF yield) with caveats
- 12-month bull/base/bear scenarios and key risks
- Source links with filing/publication dates and access date for market multiples

Note: full 8-quarter quarterly FCF cannot be fully reconstructed from the latest Q4 earnings exhibit alone because it does not provide a full quarterly cash-flow statement for Q4 periods.
